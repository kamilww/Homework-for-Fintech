#Case Study: Blockfi

##Overview and Origin:

Blockfi was founded in 2017 by Zac Prince and Flori Marquez. Blockfi aims to redefine banking by providing credit services to markets with limited access to financial products and by bridging traditional finance with blockchain technology. Company has institutional backing from Winklevoss Capital, SCB 10X, Avon Ventures, Purple Arch Ventures, Kenetic Capital, HashKey, Valar Ventures, Galaxy Digital, Fidelity, Akin Capital, SoFi, and Coinbase Ventures. Blockfi's primary custodian is Gemini. Company now has a $3 billion valuation with another $350 million in the form of Series D funding.

##Business Activities

Company is trying to bridge traditional banking with cryptocurrency by incentivizing individuals to hold their cryptocurrency on the platform by paying interest, allowing Blockfi to then lend out the funds held as a traditional bank would. The company aims to serve both institutional and retail clients. The service offerings are as follows:

\*Interest Bearing Accounts:
Blockfi generates interest for assets held by clients by lending them out to either individuals or institutional borrowers on overcollateralized terms to reduce risk. Clients may choose to deposit and earn on any of the following cryptocurrencies at this time: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Chainlink, Paxos Gold, USD coin, Binance USD, Paxos, Gemini dollar, and Tether.

\*Loans:
Company lends out client funds to institutions and individuals. Given that selling cryptocurrency is a taxable event, clients may desire to tap into their crypto holdings in the form of overcollateralized loans. Right now, the minimum loan-to-value (LTV) ratio is 50%, which starts at an interest rate of 9.75%. With an LTV of 20%, the interest rate is 4.5%

\*Trading:
The company offers a trading platform. Clients may trade between any of the 10 cryptocurrencies listed above.

\*Credit Card:
Company will start shipping a bitcoin rewards card to clients on the credit card waitlist with over 100,000 sign-ups.

\*Derivatives:
Later in 2021, OTC derivatives will be introduced.

Company is US based and regulated and has institutional backing. Company did not hold an ICO and does not offer a utility coin in its mission to be compliant with regulations. BLockfi offers excellent risk management processes and security by securing client funds with regulated custodians like Gemini, and by lending out crypto to multiple vetted, institutional counterparties. Blockfi also holds a sizable amount of collateral so clients are still able to withdraw their funds easily.

Blockfi has a top notch team and recently hired senior executives employed at JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Deutsche Bank, and World Gold Council.

##LandScape:
Company is in the crypto lending industry, which grew from $20 billion in assets under management at the end of Q3 2020 to over $40 billion at the end of the year. Right now, Blockfi has many competitors, including decentralized finance (DeFi) providers. With that said, individuals may not want to deal with the risks inherent when they self-custody their funds through DeFi and would rather to opt into a regulated, centralized lending service that more closely resembles a traditional bank.

##Results

Since the end of 2019, company grew its client base from 10,000 to over 250,000 and now manages $15 billion in assets. Revenue in 2020 was $100 million, with a projected revenue of $500 million in revenue for 2021.

Celsius Network is one of Blockfi's main competitors. Celsius has also experienced explosive growth, with its asset holdings expanding from $3.3 billion in November 2020 to $9.5 billion. its users also doubled and the platform now currently has 482,000 users. Other competitors include Nexo, which has over $5 billion in management with over a million users, and Crypto.com, which has 10 million users and offers a sophisticated DeFi platform and crypto debit card.

DeFi is a blockchain-based form of finance that doesn't require central intermediaries through the use of smart contracts. Some of the major DeFi platforms include Aave, Maker, Compound, Uniswap, SushiSwap, and 1Inch. Given how many DeFi platforms there are, with a collective market capitalization over $80 billion dollars and total value locked reaching toward $50 billion, the DeFi industry threatens to disrupt Blockfi and centralized crypto exchanges. Individuals may also choose to have control over their private keys and full custody of their crypto currency, which DeFi makes possible.

DeFi is likely being held back for now due to the technical learning curve, legal ambiguity, and scalability issues from congestion on the Ethereum network, but with improved user interfaces and scaling via other blockchains with cross-chain technology, the DeFi industry looks bright, meaning that services such as Blockfi have to consistently innovate and capitalize on being more regulation friendly.
