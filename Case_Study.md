##LandScape:
Company is in the crypto lending industry, which grew from $20 billion in assets under management at the end of Q3 2020 to over $40 billion at the end of the year. Right now, they have many competitors, including many decentralized finance providers. With that said, individuals may not want to deal with the risks inherent when they self-custody their funds, and would be more likely to opt into a regulated, centralized lending service that more closely resembles a traditional bank.

####Competitors:
Celsius Network is one of Blockfi's main competitors. Celsius has also experienced explosive growth, with its asset holdings expanding from $3.3 billion in November 2020 to $9.5 billion, with its users doubling and now currently at 482,000 users. Other competitors include Nexo, which has over $5 billion in management with over a million users, and Crypto.com. 

Also, the DeFi industry threatens to potentially disrupt the idea of centralized crypto lending services
